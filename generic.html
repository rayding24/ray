								<h2>Welcome!</h2>
								<p>Hey! It's Ray here. Come, dig in and find for yourself some good stuff you never knew about me. <br>
									For example, let's start with a super Ray-lateble trivia question: What did Ray do before his life as a programmer? <br>
									a.) Pro Gamer b.) Surfer c.) Freaking Sheldon Coope--oops I meant doing research in String Theory <br>
									Judging by the length of the choices, c is the no-brainer (if you chose a or b, my condolensces but at least 
									know that I will be trying them at some point ;)<br>
									One more time? You bet! Did you know that Ray used to rollerblade to work when he worked as Machine Learning Research Intern at 
									UBC's PLAI (Programming Langurages for Artificial Intelligence)? See? I knew you are a fast learner too!

									<h3 class="major">About Me</h3>
									<p>
										I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at Terra Sense Analytics, an AI startup in Canada. 
										My work involves implementing and training machine learning models, python scripting, infrastructure and DevOps (docker, CI/CD, automation, etc.) <br>
										Previously, I was a Machine Learning Research Intern at 
										UBC's PLAI (Programming Langurages for Artificial Intelligence) where I worked on Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML). <br>


										I graduated UBC with Combined Honours in Mathematics and Physics with Distinction and took many advanced courses in computer science
										(algorithms and data structures, machine learning and data mining, numerical computing, software construction, etc). <br>
										At school, hackathons were a great source of learning and free food, and I even got some awards along the way (e.g. WolframOne Award at NWHacks). 
										Other cool-sounding awards I had from school include Chancellor's Scholar Award and Dean's Honor Lists. I also worked as both Teaching Assistant and 
										Research Assistant in the Mathematics Department, which gives me the official stamp to tutor almost any level of math, which I think is cooler than those awrads 
										(well technically beyond a certain level tutor takes on the name of Professor/Supervisor). 

										<br>
										
										I love solving new problems and viewing the same landscape through different perspectives. When I'm not making machines learn, I can be found kayaking, hiking, 
										geeking out with friends or reading a new book. I make random stir-fries too -- have to hone my skills as a chef in case this programming thing gets automated.
